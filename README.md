##UNFAIR FRUIT NINJA

###Objective of the game (what's the point of playing)
The objective of my game is to create a _modified 
version_ of **Fruit Ninja**. I enjoy the flash game
**Unfair Mario** therefore I decided 
to _merge the two games_.
The game I created is called ***Unfair Fruit Ninja***. 
The *_goal_* of my game is to be an *extremely hard game* 
that _challenges_ you in different aspects that you 
would not *normally expect*. The _unfair_ part include: 
**insanely fast speed, invisible bombs, fruit changes 
before slicing and much more!** I think this game is a
major success and will be *_on the market by 2025 for
$23.99_*.  

###Gameplay Instructions
*The instructions to my game are listed as follows:*
1. Use your mouse to swipe through the fruits
2. Avoid bombs or you will lose a life
3. If you do not swipe the fruit and it leaves the screen
    you will lose a life
Also *_these instructions are included_* in the **"HELP"**
feature which is an *option on my intro screen*. 

###Scoring 
The *_scoring is very straight forward_*. **Once the fruit 
has been sliced one hundred points are added your current
score**. *_Once a score of five hundred points has been 
achieved bombs will begin to spawn in_*. *_Once a a score 
of 700 points has been achieved two fruits will begin to
spawn in_*.
