Be careful what you are specifying.  Be realistic given the timeline. You will be held accountable to what you specify.

Screen Mockups
In your README.md, add a new section called Screen Mock-Ups.  It is critical that you create  a visual model of what you are looking to build.  This can be a sketch on paper or done with drawing program (i.e Google Draw).  It is not acceptable to just take a screenshot of another game and use it.  The screen mockup(s) should be a rough depiction of what it will look like and will act as your guide.  Include any notes, position, and dimension markings to provide a reference to what you will create programmatically.  Insert an image into the README.md doc in your repository.


Project Task Outline
Using the Project functionality in Github, you will create a task outline of what needs to be done.  

Setting Up a Project in Github
Adding task cards to the To Do Column
When defining your task, the descriptions should be functionality/feature driven, not described programming terms. For example, spaceship keyboard control is a better description than add spaceship key conditions to on_keypress

Come up with a thorough and achievable list of cards and add them to the To Do Column.  This will represent all that needs to get done.  


Functionality Checkpoint Goals
Create a Functionality Checkpoint column in your Github project
Determine what cards in the To Do column you plan on completing by the Functionality Checkpoint.  Drag the cards into the Functionality checkpoint column.  This is what you are responsible for completing for the Functionality Checkpoint date.

Drag cards to the In Progress and column as things are being work on.  All project activity is tracked and you will be marked on your maintenance of your task list.

Code Collaboration with Github
Although there are better automated tools for collaboration in Git/Github, we will try to keep things simple for the purposes of this project.   When working with a partner you want the following files created

master.py - working/stable code that contains work for all team members
member1_development.py - working file for one team member.
member2_development.py - working file for the other team member.

In Pycharm, one person create the three files in github.  
Each person do a pull from their repository in Pycharm to get the three files.

Consider master.py to be the working version that contains the code of both partners.  All development should be done in the respective _development.py files for each partner.  Once each partner has implemented a working feature, they can add their code to master.py (with some consultation with their partner as to how they can add their code without breaking anything).

The workflow for anytime you work on the project is:

Pull from github
Add any updates from the master.py to your _development.py file
Edit your work in your  _development.py file
Update the master.py (after you've verified them to be working in your _development.py file)
Commit and push you changes to github with a meaningful, short commit message (don't just say "update" or something useless to that effect)

ALWAYS pull from github before you do anything.   This will help minimize conflicts.  Always



 


Final Code Submission
All final code should be in the master.py file in the project github repository.   No code will be accepted outside of the repository.  Make sure all images, sound, and any other file necessary for your code to work is in the github repository
Code Walk-Through Video
Record a screen recording video (max 5 min) where you will explain how you demonstrated our knowledge of the following:
usage of variables(global/local), boolean and arithmetic expressions, and lists
usage of control structures (if statements, loops)
usage of functions

Upload your video to google classroom.

EVERYONE must submit a code-walkthrough of their contribution to the code.
Demo Video
Record a short video demonstrating the actual gameplay of your game.  Provide any verbal explanations for the viewer where necessary.
Peer Evaluation
If you are working with a partner complete the Peer Evaluation (posted in Google Classroom)
Self-Evaluation
Complete the self-evaluation column of the rubric (EVERYONE must do this).
Project Reflection
